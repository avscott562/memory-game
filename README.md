## Instructions

Download the files from GitHub https://github.com/avscott562/memory-game.
Open the 'index.html' file.
Begin playing game.  You randomly flip over cards in pairs and see if the
two cards match.  If they do, excellent!  On to the next pair.  If they don't, turn them back over.  Pick another pair of cards and see if those match and so forth.  As you go through the game, try to remember where the matching cards are so you can eventually match all of the cards.  The goal is to get all of the matches in the least amount of moves and in the least amount of time.
Once all cards are matched, you've won!
Close the game or play another round.
